    abstract = {Peripheral facial palsy is an illness in which a one-sided ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles occurs due to nerve damage. Medical experts utilize visual severity grading methods to estimate this damage. Our algorithm-based method provides an objective grading using 3D point clouds. We extract from static 3D recordings facial radial curves to measure volumetric differences between both sides of the face. We analyze five patients with chronic complete peripheral facial palsy to evaluate our method by comparing changes over several recording sessions. We show that our proposed method allows an objective assessment of facial palsy.},
